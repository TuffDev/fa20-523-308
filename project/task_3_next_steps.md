# Next Steps
I am still not 100% that this is the project I want to complete. As the instructions for HW 5 laid out, we do not have to fully commit at this point to the project. I may try to work on a basic deep learning project that can introduce me to that type of work. Next steps for the project I have started here would be to complete the basic descriptive data modeling in charts. Then would be to model the data and pull in the playoff teams from 2009-2019 to compare the model output with the playoff team that qualified for the playoffs. I want to work on this over the next month before moving onto the writing portion of the project.
